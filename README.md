# skin-cancer-detection
This project aims to build a machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying different types of skin cancer. The system takes skin lesion images as input and classifies them into Normal, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), or Melanoma. It also includes a website interface to make predictions easily accessible to users.
